| Category | Item | Estimated Cost (USD) | Actual Cost (USD) | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Development** | Developer Time | $0 (Self-funded) | $0 | N/A |
| **Hosting (Cloud)** | GPU Cloud Server (e.g., RunPod/Lambda) for Demo | $20/month | $0 (Local Dev) | Pending |
| **API Costs** | OpenRouter / OpenAI (LLM Inference) | $10/month | $5 | Ongoing |
| **Domain/Net** | Domain Name + SSL (if needed) | $10/year | $0 (ngrok free) | Pending |
| **Hardware (Glasses)** | Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W | $15 | - | Future |
| **Hardware (Glasses)** | Camera Module (v2 or similar) | $25 | - | Future |
| **Hardware (Glasses)** | Battery & Power Management | $20 | - | Future |
| **Hardware (Glasses)** | Bone Conduction Transducers / Audio | $15 | - | Future |
| **Hardware (Glasses)** | 3D Printing Materials | $10 | - | Future |
| **Total (Est)** | | **~$115** | **$5** | |

**Notes:**
- Currently running on local hardware (Laptop GPU), so hosting costs are zero.
- API costs are minimal during testing/development (paid per token).
- Hardware costs are estimates for the "Smart Glasses" prototype.
